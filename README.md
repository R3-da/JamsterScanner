ðŸŽ¹ Introducing JamsterScanner: A MIDI Controller VST Plugin! ðŸŽµ

This plugin, developed using the JUCE framework (a powerful audio application development toolkit based on C++), combines chord recognition and MIDI transposition capabilities.

JamsterScanner intelligently displays real-time chord names as you play them on your MIDI keyboard. Additionally, it offers the ability to transpose MIDI input by octaves or semitones. The transposed MIDI data is then sent as MIDI output to control other VST instrument plugins.

Built on the robust and versatile JUCE framework, JamsterScanner seamlessly integrates audio processing, MIDI functionality, and GUI design. The framework also supports the incorporation of React JS for a responsive and interactive front-end.

While its current focus is MIDI transposition and chord recognition, the ultimate goal is to develop JamsterScanner into an auto-accompaniment VST plugin, emulating the YAMAHA A-1000 arranger.
